# Xamarin.Forms Evolution

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [xamarin.forms mailing list](http://lists.xamarin.com/mailman/listinfo/forms-devel) first.

This repository tracks the ongoing evolution of Xamarin.Forms. It contains:

* Goals for upcoming Xamarin.Forms releases (this document).
* The [Xamarin.Forms evolution review schedule](schedule.md) tracking proposals to change Xamarin.Forms.
* [Commonly Rejected Changes](commonly_proposed.md), proposals which have been denied in the past.

This document describes goals for the Xamarin.Forms on a per-release
basis, usually listing minor releases adding to the currently shipping
version and one major release out.  Each release will have many
smaller features or changes independent of these larger goals, and not
all goals are reached for each release.

Goals for past versions are included at the bottom of the document for
historical purposes, but are not necessarily indicative of the
features shipped. The release notes for each shipped version are the
definitive list of notable changes in each release.

## Development major version:  Xamarin.Forms 3.0

Expected release date: Late 2016

The primary goal of this release is to stabilize existing API's and add minor missing features.

### Out of Scope

A significant part of delivering a major release is in deciding what
*not* to do, which means deferring many good ideas. The following is a
sampling of potentially good ideas that are not in scope for Xamarin.Forms
3.0:

* **Backwards compatible breaking changes**: Xamarin.Forms 3.0 is intended to be fully backwards compatible with Xamarin.Forms 2.0. Any proposals that require backwards compatibility breaks are out of scope.

* **Side port API to match UWP**: This change would inherently break the non-backwards compatibility breaking changes restriction, and is thus out of scope for 3.0.

### Implemented proposals for Xamarin.Forms 3.0


## Xamarin.Forms 2.2 - Released on May 29, 2016

[This release](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/releases/tag/release-2.2.0) focused on fixing bugs and improving overall code quality by removing warnings and prepping for open sourcing. Some small features were added.
